NOTE (about ZIP structure):
THIS FILE DOES NOT FOLLOW THE REQUESTED STRUCTURE.
this is intentional. due to how the website was made, we decided to add different paths based on (a) which profile you were on and (b) which webpage you entered. 
this means that there are multiple image folders and CSS documents. there are a lot of images in this folder, so we decided to organize those as well, rather 
than have one large folder named images (though that does exist).
In short,
index.html = homepage
codeB (folder) = code regarding Brandon Miller's profile
codeT (folder) = code regarding Taylor Brelage's profile 

The code between the two are nearly identical, with the main difference being color scheme, pathing, and included images.

We understand that may make it a bit more difficult to navigate.
IF THAT IS AN ISSUE, then theres not much we can say. However you want to grade it is fine, but we think our organization system is justified and made our coding much more manageable.

CGT 141 Final Project

Team Earl
Members: Brandon Miller, Taylor Brelage

Objective:
Create a website that helps showcase artwork that we have made (portfolio website). In order to do this, we decided to split it into two halves, with each side
having an in depth look at each member of the team and their artwork.

Contributions:
Both: created mockups, coded functionality of website (we often worked together, its hard to split it up precisely)
Brandon: Worked on servers, worked on design of website
Taylor: Create Commitment Document (README), organized files


Thank you for a good semester.
